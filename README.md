Znuny LTS
===================================
Znuny LTS is a continuation of the ((OTRS)) Community Edition (Version 6.0.30) which was declared end of life (EOL) at the end of December 2020.

The primary goal for this project is to provide a maintained and stable version of the well known ticket system.

The second goal is to reestablish a connection to the community.

This project will keep the compatibility with implementations and integrations built upon version 6 of ((OTRS)) Community Edition.
